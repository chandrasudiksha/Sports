    <img src="img1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>It's made a spluttering sort of start in Test cricket: 
        Rohit missed three of India's five Tests since he became their all-format captain. 
        Injuries, in fact, have forced Rohit to miss eight of India's last 10 Test matches. 
        He was Player of the Match in India's last Test before this stretch of games, 
        a landmark victory that took them to a 2-1 series lead in England, 
        months after they had beaten Australia 2-1 in Australia.</p>
